Hash and Length Checker Tool

The Hash and Length Checker Tool is a versatile command-line utility designed to assist users in various text analysis and file processing tasks. Developed in Python, this tool offers functionality to calculate hashes, validate text lengths, and analyze text files for specific word lengths. With support for duplicate detection and customizable output, it provides users with valuable insights into their textual data.
Features:

    Calculate Hash: Generate cryptographic hash values for input text.
    Check Text Length: Validate if a text string matches a specified length.
    Check File Length: Scan text files to identify words of a given length.

Usage:

The Hash and Length Checker Tool offers simple command-line interface options:

Calculate Hash:python hash_checker.py calculate <text>

example:python hash_checker.py calculate 'Hello'

check text length: python hash_checker.py calculate 'Hello'

Example: python hash_checker.py checktextlength 'Hello' 5


Check File Length: python hash_checker.py checkfilelength <file_path> <length> [num_words]

Example: python hash_checker.py checkfilelength file.txt 32
Optional: Output a specific number of words: python hash_checker.py checkfilelength file.txt 32 10

Output:

    Hash calculation and text length checks provide straightforward true/false results.
    File length checks display identified words along with their duplicates (if any) and the total word count in the file.

Notes:

    Ensure proper quoting of text inputs containing spaces.
    For file paths, provide either absolute or relative path references.
